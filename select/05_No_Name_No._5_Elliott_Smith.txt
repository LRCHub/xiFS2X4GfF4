Got bitten fingernails
And a head full of the past
And everybody's gone at last
Sweet, sweet smile
That's fading fast
'Cause everybody's gone at last
Don't get upset about it
No, not anymore
There's nothing wrong
That wasn't wrong before
Had a second alone
With a chance let pass
And everybody's gone at last
Well, I hope you're not waiting
Waitin' 'round for me
'Cause I'm not going anywhere
Obviously
Got a broken heart
And your name on my cast
And everybody's gone at last
Everybody's gone at last
